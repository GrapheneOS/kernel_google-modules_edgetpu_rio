/*
 * The inter-IP fence.
 *
 * The meaning of "a fence is signaled" or "unblocked" is that the fence has been signaled enough
 * times as many as the expected number of signals which is decided when the fence is initialized
 * and it has been unblocked. That says every single signaler commands are expected to signal the
 * fence (i.e., call `iif_fence_signal{_with_status}` function) even though commands weren't
 * processed normally.
 *
 * Also, unblocking a fence here is only for the kernel perspective. Therefore, the IIF driver will
 * notify the fence unblock to only who are polling the fences (via poll callbacks or poll syscall).
 * It means that if the signaler is an IP, not AP, it is a responsibility of the IP side to unblock
 * a fence and propagate an error to waiter IPs. Therefore, unblocking fence by the IIF driver will
 * not unblock the fences in the IP side unless the IP kernel driver notices the fence unblock via
 * a poll callback and asks their IP to unblock the fence.
 *
 * If the signaler IP requires a support of the kernel driver to unblock the fence in case the IP is
 * already faulty and can't notify waiter IPs, the signaler IP kernel driver can unblock the fence
 * with an error and each waiter IP kernel driver can notice it by `fence_unblocked` operator of the
 * fence manager or registering a poll callback to the fence directly and propagate the error to the
 * IP of each.
 *
 * Besides, one of the main roles of the IIF driver is creating fences with assigning fence IDs,
 * initializing the fence table and managing the life cycle of them.
